## Work

I have had monotonous jobs in the past. Jobs with a singular task or
requirement. Jobs with no need for insight or thought. Younger me thought these
jobs were ideal. I performed a task and in return received compensation.
Painting houses for instance didn’t require much mental focus. It wasn’t long,
however, before I realized that the allure of such singularity was not
met with personal satisfaction.

I was simply trading physical output and time for dollars. There was no
progression.

It was this realization that pushed me to search for a career that would require
constant progression. Something which forced me to deal with difficult tasks and
find solutions. To learn.
