his apprenticeship starting in 1977 in a small service facility that specialized
in European cars primarily of Italian and German origin.</p>
                                <p class="indent">He was trained and overseen by
an experienced and high skilled graduate of the British Automotive Technical
School and Apprenticeship system. Along with his regular employment during 1980
and 1981, much of Jerry's time was spent designing, rebuilding, setting up, and
handling of all the non-driving activities in a successful SCCA GT-3
campaign.</p>

                                <p class="indent">A New Jersey native, Bill
began his technical training at Denver's Automotive and Diesel College in 1982.
From there he went on to study at the Engine City Technical Institute in Union
City, New Jersey. For the next three years Bill worked on vehicles ranging from
domestic cars to tractor trailers. Bill first discovered his interest in German
cars at Hans Carol, where he served as a technician repairing Mercedes Benz,
Audi, BMW, Volkswagen and Porsche automobiles. Bill was then exposed to other
marques, including Rolls Royce and Jaguar when he moved to Short Hills, New
Jersey where he was employed by Independent Systems T/A Curtis & Scotty.</p>
                                <p class="indent">In 1991 fate brought Bill to
Massachusetts and ultimately to EPE. Here, Bill has developed all of the skills
required to be a top level Porsche technician. As the senior technician, he is
particularly adept at diagnosing problems in all of the complex systems employed
by modern Porsches. Bill takes pride in resolving the most difficult emission,
drivability and electrical problems and can often be found coaching our less
experienced technicians, helping them hone their skills.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Bill is married and resides in
Stow with his wife Brooke and their two beautiful daughters. Outside of work,
Bill enjoys spending time with his family, skiing and fly fishing.</p>

                                <p class="indent">Matt was raised on the South
Shore where he graduated from Sacred Heart High School in Kingston,
Massachusetts. He began his automotive career at age 15, working as a service
writer at European Car Doctors, a business owned by his father.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Shortly after graduation, he
moved to Germany to experience and embrace his father’s heritage. On returning
to America, he began full time employment at European Car Doctors training with
a factory trained Mercedes Benz technician. Matt apprenticed for 5 years working
on Mercedes Benz, Audi, BMW and Porsche. He then moved to a small, independent
repair shop working primarily on German and Japanese cars. Matt came to EPE in
the summer of 2004, aspiring to specialize in the repair of Porsche street and
race cars.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Away from the shop, Matt
enjoys the outdoors and all things motorized, including his 911 which he is
preparing for dedicated track use. Matt is married and lives in Clinton with
wife Jennifer.</p>

                                <p class="indent">Jim Miller has been a key
member of the EPE team since 1988. He joined us as our shop assistant while
still attending Framingham High School. Jim then went on to study at Virginia
Commonwealth University where he received a B.S. in Public Relations with a
concentration in marketing and accounting. After graduating, Jim returned to EPE
and took over the administrative duties as Director of Operations.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Although Jim has undertaken
other challenges recently, he continues to carry out his responsibilities here.
Jim is one of EPE's most versatile and loyal employees, always making the effort
to improve the workplace whether here at the shop or in the pits at Daytona,
where he has spearheaded many of our finest race efforts as team manager.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Jim lives in Framingham with
his wife Ellen and their 2 adorable children. When not working, Jim's pastimes
include sports as a spectator, as well as a participant and spending as much
time as possible with his young family.</p>

                            <div class="center-words">
                                <p class="indent">Bob has been driving Porsches
for most of the last 25 years and he has had an association with EPE for most of
them.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Over the years Bob has been
involved with us in many capacities, originally as a customer and since retiring
from the medical supply industry, has fulfilled many roles here. We have drawn
on Bob's experience and expertise in many areas ranging from organizational
stratagies and strategic planning as well as product and equipment procurement.
Bob's day-to-day contributions include logistical and practical duties, all of
which help the shop operate in the most efficient manner possible.</p>
                                <p class="indent">It is however Bob's role as
“consigliere” that will always be most appreciated by all of us at EPE. Whether
the issue is professional or private, his perspective is always a valued and
welcome one.</p>
                                <p class="indent">Until recently, Bob shared a 
1991 Porsche Cup car with his long-time friend Dion Tsourides. Together they 
participated in PCA club races as well as Driver Education events.</p>
                                <p class="indent">As a veteran instructor with
the Porsche Club of America, he has been an inspiration for many younger
drivers. Bob and his wife Martha live in Framingham and spend much of their
spare time playing golf and enjoying time with their grandchildren.</p>
