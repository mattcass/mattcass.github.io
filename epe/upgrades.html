it can be difficult if not impossible to determine the best approach when
dealing with upgrades to any aspect of you Porsche. While many seem too good to
be true, most are. The market is full of “snake oil” salesmen all pushing there
wares, many with no practical experience with what they are selling,let alone
what you are driving.  At EPE we've had tremendous success in every form of
racing we have undertaken in partnership with our many professional and amateur
clients.</p> 
                            <p class="indent">Over the years and through the use of
scientific measurements, lap time and feedback from experienced professional as
well as some of the best amateur drivers, we have been able to separate true
performance enhancing parts and techniques from the often performance degrading
modifications and for lack of a better word,”junk”that is currently on the
market.</p>
                            <p class="indent"> We offer tried and true, tested and proven parts
from well known and some not so well know suppliers. We install all of the fine
product that we sell and therefore  can guarantee  that you get all of the
performance that you paid for.  EPE will never use a client as the guinea pig
for any product or upgrade. On occasion, a client might want to try something
new, a product or technique we have little or no experience with. In that case
we will work with  that client to insure that he or she is never put in an
unsafe situation and will always take whatever steps necessary to insure their
safety at all times.</p>

                            <p class="indent ">Data acquisition has become
an invaluable tool for establishing racecar - and car/driver - performance. Now
that the ability exists to analyze each and every performance parameter for car
and driver, accurate use of this data can provide a key advantage on the
racetrack. EPE provides a thorough overview of the varied methods for analyzing
racecar data acquisition system outputs, with a focus on vehicle dynamics.</p>
                            <p class="indent">We can install any data
aquision system, and help you analyze the resulting data, make the needed
adjustments, and help you to realize the driver inputs that are satisfactory, or
perhaps need a tweak or two.</p>

                            <p class="indent">An often overlooked opportunity to
increase performance can be found in a gearbox.</p>
                            <p class="indent">The selection of proper gear
ratios will help your car accelerate harder while allowing the driver to keep
the engine in its ideal operating range. This type of enhancement translates to
far better performance without compromising your vehicles reliability.</p>
                            <p class="indent">Gearbox oil coolers have also
become more important than ever with the increase in engine size and power
output from many Porsche engines. Installing a pump and cooler is no longer a
luxury reserved for only endurance race cars. This enhancement can extend the
life of all gearbox components saving far more in the long run than the modest
investment they require. We also install both factory and aftermarket limited
slip differentials assemblies and can also offer a comprehensive selection of
final drive gear ratios.</p>

                                <p class="indent">Track driving as well as
autocrossing can put stresses on clutch and flywheel assembles that were never
planned for by the factory engineers.</p>
                                <p class="indent">These often overlooked components need to
be considered anytime you plan on using your Porsche outside the scope of its
original design parameters. Many Porsches were originally supplied with clutch
discs using a rubber hub to isolate the car’s occupants from drive line noise
and vibrations. More recently Porsche has moved this damping material into the
flywheel assembly, referred to as a “dual mass” flywheel. While this works in
most applications, it has shown to be a weak link when the car is driven in a
more aggressive fashion.</p>
                            <p class="indent">he solution is the installation of
a clutch disc with a spring center and in some cases, a one piece flywheel as
well. We also have installed racing clutches that employ multiple discs of a
smaller dimension. Selected with an understanding of the intended use of the
car, as well as the expectations of the client, EPE will install a clutch and
flywheel assembly that will deliver all of the performance you want, the
reliability you need, and the ease of operation you have come to expect from
your Porsche.</p>

                            <p class="indent">Perhaps the area of greatest
compromise in any Porsche street car is in its suspension system. The car is
designed  to perform well under all conditions on all types of roads and in all
kinds of weather,  while remaining quiet, poised and easy to drive and control.
However, if you plan to use your Porsche on the race  track or  for  weekend
autocrossing, EPE has the ability, knowledge and experience to modify you
suspension, choosing  from  the broad spectrum of available options. With an
expansive catalog of  proven suspension packages and set ups, our staff can help
guide you through the myriad of chassis upgrade options recommending those  most
appropriate for your intended use and maximize your driving pleasure on both the
street and the track.</p>
                            <p class="indent">With the increasing availability
of  affordable shock absorbers with double and even triple adjustments, a driver
is no longer limited to the performance enhancements offered by a simple set of
aftermarket  sway bars. Working with companies such as Moton, Ohlins, Bilstein,
JRZ and Koni we can furnish clients with anything from replacements for their
worn original equipment shocks and springs to a fully sorted race tested
suspension package. The installation of mono ball bushings and mounts in
conjunction with stiffer springs will permit more accurate alignment setting and
enable  the driver to take full advantage the latest track tire technology
available. These changes will  transform your car into a  faster and more
responsive vehicle thereby  making it be easier to drive and thus a superior
learning tool.</p>

                            <p class="indent">Modern race  tire technology  has
done more to lower lap times than any other single advancement.</p>
                            <p class="indent">Todays DOT legal track tires have
capabilities well beyond the the performance envelope available in even the most
exotic full  race tires just a short time ago. Previously  when setting up a
track car, it  was as simple as installing heavy duty shock absorbers, stiffer
anti-sway bars and a set of sticky tires. Todays  track tires can generate
sufficient cornering loads to render those suspension set ups  woefully
inadequate. This is a prime example of the need to consider  the chassis and
tire combination  from a completely “holistic” perspective. For example, your
car was originally shod with tires designed for “normal” street use. They are
made to work under all conditions including on both wet and dry roads as well as
over a fairly broad temperature range. Together with the standard suspension
they can allow your car to generate at most approximately .8g of cornering
force. When you install track tires that have 30% greater grip potential  the
car will lean over much further in cornering, perhaps  enough to  cause the
suspension to bottom out, creating a very perilous situation.</p>
                            <p class="indent">Under braking, the front tires
can  have enough grip to cause the nose of the car to dive so severely that the
rear tires can become unloaded.  This condition is will almost always result in
a spin even by the most  experienced driver.</p>
                            <p class="indent">With a sensible approach and an
understanding of all of the components involved, we can recommend a wheel and
tire combination that along with the suspension upgrades previously outlined
will assure any driver achieves maximum  return on their wheel and tire
investments.</p>
