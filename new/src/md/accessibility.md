## Accessibility In The Modern Age

I have been watching a lot of lectures and talks on JavaScript, Linux, open
sourcing code and the like. Surprisingly I am starting to understand more of
what is being discussed and referred to. Most of the talks are rather abstract
or broad. They are not particularly trying to teach you any special languages.
They certainly are not tutorials. In fact the whole discussion is based around
the fact that you already know and use a certain programming language. So why
bother watching them if I am not learning language syntax or real world code
examples?

A few reasons really. I think the primary reason that draws me to these talks is
trying to understand the context of language uses. To understand the inner
workings of the industry as well as use cases that I might not even know of yet.
I don't quite know ruby but I still find it interesting to listen to someone
rant about their workflow or specific issues they have run into.

A second and slightly more enthralling reason is that web industry is still
relatively new. Technologies are ever evolving and new methods are constantly
being developed and adopted. With this youth we are given a great opportunity to
watch and learn from the industry leaders. The very people who are developing
new tools that we might be using on a day to day basis.

Most of the authors who I admire are no longer with us. I can't send an email or
a tweet to Jack Kerouac. Not that I would want to as that might remove the
mysticism which elevates his status. Nevertheless it is quite cool that the
dude's who created bootstrap or node.js are only 140 characters away.
