He spent the afternoon hyped up on caffeine and a nervous excited energy. Unable
to remain focused he day dreamed of productivity and finished products. Every
once in a short while though, as if like a bolt of lightning striking down he

he would fret. The cycle would begin anew. Distraught dissatisfaction over what
could have been and a constant pang of fear that he did not have the guile to
see his lofty goals through to the end.

Suddenly without warning the clock struck midnight. Productivity having given
way to music videos and repetitive click-bait content, he became just another
unrealized procrastinating wanderer of the web.

moments of concentration before he was once again enraptured in a battle of
semicolons and haphazard div tags in his quest to produce.
