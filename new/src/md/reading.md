## More, Better, Reading

A good friend of mine from high school introduced me to what he called at the
time "The Summer of Literature". It was a self-induced effort on his part to
read more and better material. Literature. It's no wonder he would later became
an english teacher.

I've always considered myself an avid reader. I read all of the Lord of the
Rings including the Hobbit before high school, I finished each Harry Potter book
within a few days of its release, and I can still recall some of the plots to
the various Hardy Boys I managed to get my hands on.

I liked to read. However, I had never intentionally made a concerted effort to
read any classics. That is, until "The Summer of Literature." My friend would
let me borrow whatever book he had just finished. From 1984 to Catch 22. We read
a lot.

He even finished War and Peace, a feat I so ungraciously chose not to pursue.
Although a copy does sit on my bookshelf today. Glaring at me.

At some point in the last year or so I realized I had fallen into my old ways. I
was still reading, just nothing great. After a conversation with my sister about
this exact topic I came to the conclusion that I should once again curate the
books I delved into. I wanted to read better material. Novels, classics, and
historical non-fiction.
