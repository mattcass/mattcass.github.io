Surprisingly I am starting to understand more of what is being discussed and referred to. Most of the talks are rather abstract or broad. They are not particularly trying to teach you any special languages. They certainly are not tutorials. In fact the whole discussion is based around the fact that you already know and use a certain programming language. So why bother watching them if I am not learning language syntax or real world code examples?</p> <p>A few reasons really. I think the primary reason that draws me to these talks is trying to understand the context of language uses. To understand the inner workings of the industry as well as use cases that I might not even know of yet. I don&#39;t quite know ruby but I still find it interesting to listen to someone rant about their workflow or specific issues they have run into.</p> <p>A second and slightly more enthralling reason is that web industry is still relatively new. Technologies are ever evolving and new methods are constantly being developed and adopted. With this youth we are given a great opportunity to watch and learn from the industry leaders. The very people who are developing new tools that we might be using on a day to day basis.</p> <p>Most of the authors who I admire are no longer with us. I can&#39;t send an email or a tweet to Jack Kerouac. Not that I would want to as that might remove the mysticism which elevates his status.

Most days he powered through the haze, deciding to become a member of society. Wake up with the birds as it were.</p> <p>Down the stairs, around the corner, into the kitchen. He flipped the grubby worn switch to turn on the fluorescent lights which adorned the kitchen ceiling and turned on the radio. The words fluttered around his head but were not making their way in. He pulled the plug and instead found a well worn album. The same album which used to wake him up in college. His head began bouncing along with the familiar tunes. Much better.</p> <p>The kettle began to hiss as the ground coffee beans whizzed through the grinder. The dark, rich, aromatic scent was already wafting through the air as he poured the boiling water into the french press and swirled the grounds into a froth.

Surprisingly I am starting to understand more of what is being discussed and referred to. Most of the talks are rather abstract or broad. They are not particularly trying to teach you any special languages. They certainly are not tutorials. In fact the whole discussion is based around the fact that you already know and use a certain programming language. So why bother watching them if I am not learning language syntax or real world code examples?</p> <p>A few reasons really. I think the primary reason that draws me to these talks is trying to understand the context of language uses. To understand the inner workings of the industry as well as use cases that I might not even know of yet. I don&#39;t quite know ruby but I still find it interesting to listen to someone rant about their workflow or specific issues they have run into.</p> <p>A second and slightly more enthralling reason is that web industry is still relatively new. Technologies are ever evolving and new methods are constantly being developed and adopted. With this youth we are given a great opportunity to watch and learn from the industry leaders. The very people who are developing new tools that we might be using on a day to day basis.</p> <p>Most of the authors who I admire are no longer with us. I can&#39;t send an email or a tweet to Jack Kerouac. Not that I would want to as that might remove the mysticism which elevates his status.

Literally jumping out of bed and bounding across the room. His alarm was blaring, screaming at him to get up. It worked wonders; mostly because he was terrified that his roommates might murder him if he failed to turn it off immediately. The key was keeping the alarm well across the room to prevent any possible snoozing while still attached to the dreams floating through his hazy half sleeping mind.</p> <p>Frightened to death and standing there in the middle of the room, reality began to creep back in. The dreams still lingered but he was awake. He was up. This was a pivotal moment. His next immediate actions would begin to define his day. Whether he pulled himself together, grabbed the crumpled clothes laying on his floor and stumbled downstairs in search of coffee and a large glass of water or he slipped back into the still warm comforters and the dreams which seemed distinctly real. Most days he powered through the haze, deciding to become a member of society. Wake up with the birds as it were.</p> <p>Down the stairs, around the corner, into the kitchen. He flipped the grubby worn switch to turn on the fluorescent lights which adorned the kitchen ceiling and turned on the radio. The words fluttered around his head but were not making their way in. He pulled the plug and instead found a well worn album. The same album which used to wake him up in college. His head began bouncing along with the familiar tunes. Much better.</p> <p>The kettle began to hiss as the ground coffee beans whizzed through the grinder. The dark, rich, aromatic scent was already wafting through the air as he poured the boiling water into the french press and swirled the grounds into a froth. Wondering as the steam rose through the air if he actually enjoyed the product of his actions. Was he addicted to coffee or did the ritual of making coffee simply take control long ago?

It&#39;s no wonder he would later became an english teacher.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always considered myself an avid reader.

However, I had never intentionally made a concerted effort to read any classics. That is, until &quot;The Summer of Literature.&quot; My friend would let me borrow whatever book he had just finished. From 1984 to Catch 22. We read a lot.</p> <p>He even finished War and Peace, a feat I so ungraciously chose not to pursue. Although a copy does sit on my bookshelf today. Glaring at me.</p> <p>At some point in the last year or so I realized I had fallen into my old ways. I was still reading, just nothing great. After a conversation with my sister about this exact topic I came to the conclusion that I should once again curate the books I delved into. I wanted to read better material.

Not to mention the fact that it looked liked proper hacking when working through the command line. I was sold. The only problem was I didn&#39;t know how to actually use it. How do you save a file? How do you open a new file? How do you copy and paste? These are all relatively simple things.

It boiled down to a decision to continuously use Vim and to write down things that annoyed you while working. Like how to delete the text between two html tags.
