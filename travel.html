                    <h3>Initial thoughts </h3>
                    <p class="line" >Bike share (air bike and bike)?</p>
                    <img class="smaller" src="images/travel/bike.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Solve the issue of having to travel with a huge bike
                        box.</p> 
                    <p>However,
                        <br>- most major cities already have well established
                        bike share programs (e.g. Hubway).
                        <br>- You would have to get an appropriately fitting bike, ensure it is in
                        working order.
                        <br>- As much as I love cycling I would not feel confident handing over one of
                        my bikes to an internet stranger.</p>

                <h3>So then I began to think about why we travel in the first
                    place?</h3>
                    <p>What I gathered for the answer is to get a glimpse of, personally
                        experience, and to better understand a new and different
                        culture.</p>
                <h4>This becomes the  most important problem facing the user?</h4>
                    <p>The core issue my App is trying to solve for a traveller/user is 
                        how do you get to know a place, without having been
                        there?  How do you further understand a location and
                        culture you are visiting?</p>
                    <p>Naturally the clear answer to this question is through books.</p>
                    <img class="smaller" src="images/travel/books.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="content--left">
                    <h3>Product.</h3>
                    <p class="bold">The application thus takes user input via location 
                        and recommends books/novesl based on this information.</p>
                    <p>Who might the product user be?</p?>
                    <img src="images/travel/userpersona.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="content--left">
                    <h4>What is the user story while using what you built?</h4>
                    <p>Most destination trips begin long before the airplane
                        takes off. There are likely weeks of planning,
                        coordinating logistics, finding hotels, and the like.
                        Some might even spend months saving up $$ to afford
                        their trip.</p>

                    <h4>What does and does not work?</h4>
                    <p> well, let me expound on this a little bit</p>
                    <h4>What would you do next based on feedback?</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="content--left">
                    <h4>How did you convince the person, make them want to do
                        something?</h4>
                    <p> well, let me expound on this a little bit</p>
                </div>
                    <p>The app itself is at its heart a location oriented book
                        recommendation app. not just for travel centric. Can be
                    location oriented readers as well.</p>
