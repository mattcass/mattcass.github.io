                    <h3>Initial thoughts </h3>
                    <p class="line" >Bike share (air bike and bike)?</p>
                    <img class="smaller" src="images/travel/bike.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Solve the issue of having to travel with a huge bike
                        box.</p> 
                    <p>However,
                        <br>- most major cities already have well established
                        bike share programs (e.g. Hubway).
                        <br>- You would have to get an appropriately fitting bike, ensure it is in
                        working order.
                        <br>- As much as I love cycling I would not feel confident handing over one of
                        my bikes to an internet stranger.</p>

                <h3>So then I began to think about why we travel in the first
                    place?</h3>
                    <p>What I gathered for the answer is to get a glimpse of, personally
                        experience, and to better understand a new and different
                        culture.</p>
                <h4>This, then becomes the  most important problem facing the
                    user.</h4>
                    <p>The core issue my App is trying to solve for a traveller/user is 
                        how do you get to know a place, without having been
                        there?  Or, is there a way to further understand a location and
                        culture you are visiting?</p>
                    <p>Naturally the clear answer to this question is through books.</p>
                    <img class="smaller" src="images/travel/books.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="content--left">
                    <h3>Product.</h3>
                    <p class="bold">The application which would solve this
                        problem takes user input via location 
                        and recommends books/novesl based on this information.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content--left">
                    <h3>Who might use something like this? [Users]</h3>
                    <img src="images/travel/userpersona.jpg" alt="">

                <div class="content--left">
                    <h4>What is the user story while using what you built?</h4>
                    <p>Most destination trips begin long before the airplane
                        takes off. There are likely weeks of planning,
                        coordinating logistics, finding hotels, and the like.
                        Some might even spend months saving up $$ to afford
                        their trip.</p>
                    <img src="images/travel/userstory.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>During this period a user could input their destined
                        location and receive book recommendations which pertain
                        to their trip.</p>
                    <p>For last minute trips you could download a kindle version
                        of a book or an audio recording as well.</p>
                    <img src="images/travel/timeline.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="content--left">
                    <h3>Design.</h3>
                    <img src="images/travel/screenshot.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="images/travel/prototype.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>I designed a simple interface which uses google map
                        reverse geo location to find the user. This information
                        is then used via the Amazon Product Advertising API to
                        search for and display books.</p>
                    <h4>What does and does not work?</h4>
                    <p>The idea is straightforward and my initial
                        designs created a very simple product for a specific
                        user. However, the feedback I got was for much more
                        refined and added functionalities.</p>
                    <p>Users wanted 
                        <br>- To be able to remove books from the list that they
                        have already read.
                        <br>Sort books by categories.
                        <br>Save books to purchase later.
                        <br>Rate books (similar to netflix) to influence a more
                        refined product search.</p>
                    <h4>What would you do next based on feedback?</h4>
                        <p>Based on feedback I think there is potential for a
                            social oriented book sharing app. In the marketplace
                            right now 'GoodReads' seems to do just that.</p>
                        <p>Instead of creating another social app I can almost
                            imagine this product merging into an already
                            existing social platform. Instagram is able to tag
                            your photos based on location, there could be a page
                            which uses this information to suggest reading
                            material.</p>
